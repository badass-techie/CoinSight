## Inspiration

The main inspiration behind CoinSight was the need for a reliable and efficient tool that cryptocurrency traders could use to:

1. Access historical price data
2. Obtain future price predictions
3. Make informed decisions about their investments

By combining blockchain data indexing with AI-powered predictions, CoinSight aims to provide a comprehensive solution for crypto traders.

## Challenges Faced

1. **Data Availability**: Finding the right smart contracts to query for historical price data proved challenging. Many contracts initially considered for the subgraph did not have sufficient historical data to make informed predictions.

2. **Documentation Gaps**: The team faced difficulties due to insufficient documentation for some of the tools used in the project. This required additional research and experimentation to implement certain features correctly.
